# project-euler

My solutions for problems posed on https://projecteuler.net/. All solutions are done with 
either Python or the old fashioned way with pencil and paper. I did my best to avoid using 
any libraries that make the problem trivial but allow for convenience functions: min/max, mean,
matrix multiplication, etc. In general, I try not to leave the answers in any output.
