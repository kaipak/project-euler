# project-euler

My solutions for problems posed on https://projecteuler.net/. All solutions are done with 
either Python or the old fashioned analytical way with pencil and paper (or in the digital 
sense, with $\LaTeX$). I avoided using any libraries or built-in functions (LCM, prime 
factorization, etc.) since most of the problems rely pretty heavily on being able to work 
with and see patterns in such things and using these functions renders the problem trivial. 
I gave myself a pass on using helper functions such as sort, or min/max.
